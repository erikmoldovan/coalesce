"description": "<p><b>Where: North Cascades<br/>Length: 10.4 miles roundtrip<br/>Elevation Gain: 1400 feet</b></p> <p><b>Difficulty: Easy, a pleasant trail with a steep but short climb to the lake</b></p> <p><b> Northwest Forest Pass required</b></p> <p>7:00 AM: Meet at the Ash Way P&amp;R to arrange carpools if needed. GO TO THE BUS STOPS, NORTH END OF PARK &amp; RIDE (Imagine I-5 North and follow the direction when you try to find the north end of P&amp;R)</p> <p>8:30 AM: Arrive at the trailhead, start hiking</p> <p>12 PM: Lunch by the lake</p> <p>1 PM: Start heading back to the cars</p> <p>3:30-4 PM: Drive back to Lynnwood</p> <p>6: PM: Arrive at the Ash Way P&amp;R</p> <p>Optional: Dinner in Granite Falls</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/9/8/600_425393912.jpeg\" /></p> <p>A nice hike with plenty of variety. Beautiful forest, a rushing creek, waterfalls of all shapes and sizes, history, and of course a large blue-green lake surrounded by snowy peaks. At 10.4 miles, it can be either a day-hike or a quick early season overnight. </p> <p>The trail starts at the far end of the large parking lot. In just a few minutes, come to a well signed junction for the Upper Elliot and Lower Elliot trails. They’ll rejoin in approximately three miles, so the choice is yours.</p> <p>The trail to the right drops down to the creek. You will be on a twisty trail surrounded by conifers, alders, ferns and skunk cabbage. The first mile or so is close enough to hear the creek and periodically enjoy peek-a-boo views of it. The tread is soft, and the stream crossings are small with stepping stones that may be partially submerged in the early season.</p> <p>Shortly after the trails rejoin, the way gets a little rocky and the grade steepens. As you switchback up the hillside, keep your eyes and ears open for a large waterfall on your right. Continuing uphill, arrive at the root-ball of a large fallen tree. The trail switchbacks to the left here, but the adventurous will want to take a quick side trip to the right. There was once an old wood-planked road here and a bridge across the river to an old town site. The bridge is gone, but there is still a rushing waterfall worth visiting. You’ll have to contend with some fallen trees, but none of them are too bad.</p> <p>After a bit more climbing, reach a well-signed junction just before the lake. The campsites and two open-air privies are to the left. There are at least 15 sites here, though none of them are particularly private. The forest is open and the camp resembles a terraced hillside. The trail to the lake continues to the right. After a short distance, arrive at a signed day-use area. This is your best bet for a lunch overlooking the lake, or for letting your kids run around. Even though the trail is popular, there is some room to spread out here.</p> <p><b>Driving Directions</b><br/>Take the Mountain Loop Highway east from Granite Falls. Pass by the Verlot Ranger Station, where you can buy a Northwest Forest Pass if you need one. Continue to the end of the pavement, and then go another 3.5 miles. Turn right at the road signed \"Elliot and Goat Lakes.\" This is FR-4080, but the road number is not clearly marked. The parking lot is at the end of the good gravel road.</p> <p><b>Please prepare $15 for your driver and a plastic bag for you muddy boots.</b></p> <p><b>Two no-shows and/or late cancellations and you wouldn\"t be able to participate in my future events. </b></p>",

This gives each member the opportunity to speak for 8 minutes in more detail about their business or a particular topic of their choice. We then do some quick, structured brain-storming on how we can help the speaker\"s business.</p> <p>We finish by passing referrals, giving testimonials or a quick commercial for yourself again and then wrap things up!!</p> <p>We\"re a really fun, laid-back yet professional group that loves to get together and help each others\" business. We highly encourage referrals and one-on-one meetings between members.
